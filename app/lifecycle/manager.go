// Package lifecycle provides a life cycle manager abstracting the starting and stopping
// of processes by registered start or stop hooks.
//
// The following features as supported:
//   - Start hooks can either be called synchronously or asynchronously.
//   - Start hooks can use the application context (hard shutdown) or background context (graceful shutdown).
//   - Stop hooks are synchronous and use a shutdown context with 10s timeout.
//   - Ordering of start and stop hooks.
//   - Any error from start hooks immediately triggers graceful shutdown.
//   - Closing application context triggers graceful shutdown.
//   - Any error from stop hooks immediately triggers hard shutdown.
