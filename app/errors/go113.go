//
// The chain consists of err itself followed by the sequence of errors obtained by
// repeatedly calling Unwrap.

// it implements a method Is(error) bool such that Is(target) returns true.

// repeatedly calling Unwrap.
//
// An error matches target if the error's concrete value is assignable to the value
// pointed to by target, or if the error has a method As(interface{}) bool such that
// As(target) returns true. In the latter case, the As method is responsible for
// setting target.
//
// As will panic if target is not a non-nil pointer to either a type that implements
// error, or to any interface type. As returns false if err is nil.

// type contains an Unwrap method returning error.
