This repo contains the source code for the distributed validator client _Charon_ (pronounced 'kharon'); a HTTP middleware client for Ethereum Staking that enables you to safely run a single validator across a group of independent nodes.

Charon is accompanied by a webapp called the [Distributed Validator Launchpad](https://goerli.launchpad.obol.tech/) for distributed validator key creation.

Charon is used by stakers to distribute the responsibility of running Ethereum Validators across a number of different instances and client implementations.

###### A Distributed Validator Cluster that uses the Charon client to hedge client and hardware failure risks

## Quickstart

The easiest way to test out charon is with the [charon-distributed-validator-cluster](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon-distributed-validator-cluster) repo
which contains a docker compose setup for running a full charon cluster on your local machine.

## Documentation

The [Obol Docs](https://docs.obol.tech/) website is the best place to get started.
The important sections are [intro](https://docs.obol.tech/docs/intro),
[key concepts](https://docs.obol.tech/docs/int/key-concepts) and [charon](https://docs.obol.tech/docs/charon/intro).

For detailed documentation on this repo, see the [docs](docs) folder:

- [Configuration](docs/configuration.md): Configuring a charon node
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md): Overview of charon cluster and node architecture
- [Project Structure](docs/structure.md): Project folder structure
- [Branching and Release Model](docs/branching.md): Git branching and release model
- [Go Guidelines](docs/goguidelines.md): Guidelines and principals relating to go development
- [Contributing](docs/contributing.md): How to contribute to charon; githooks, PR templates, etc.

There is always the [charon godocs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/obolnetwork/charon) for the source code documentation.

## Project Status

See [dvt.obol.tech](https://dvt.obol.tech/) for the latest status of the Obol Network including which upstream consensus clients and which downstream validators are supported.

## Version compatibility

Considering (semver)[https://semver.org] as the project's versioning scheme, two given versions of Charon are:
 - **compatible** if their `MAJOR` number is the same, `MINOR` and `PATCH` numbers differ
 - **incompatible** if their `MAJOR` number differs

There are several reasons to justify a new `MAJOR` release, for example:
 - a new Ethereum hardfork
 - an old Ethereum hardfork is removed due to network inactivity
 - modifications to the internal P2P network or consensus mechanism requiring deep changes to the codebase

The `charon dkg` subcommand **is more restrictive** than this general compatibility promise; all peers should use matching`MAJOR` and`MINOR` versions of Charon for the DKG process, patch versions may differ though it is recommended to use the latest patch of any version.
