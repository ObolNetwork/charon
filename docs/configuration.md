# Charon Configuration

This document describes the configuration options for running a charon node and cluster locally or in production.

## Cluster Config Files

A charon cluster is configured in two steps:
- `cluster-definition.json` which defines the intended cluster configuration without validator keys.
- `cluster-lock.json` which includes and extends `cluster-definition.json` with distributed validator bls public key shares.

The `charon create dkg` command is used to create `cluster-definition.json` file which is used as input to `charon dkg`.

The `charon create cluster` command combines both steps into one and just outputs the final `cluster-lock.json` without a DKG step.

The schema of the `cluster-definition.json` is defined as:
```json
{
  "name": "best cluster",                       // Cosmetic cluster name
  "creator": {                                  // Creator of this cluster definition
    "address": "0x123..abfc",                   // ETH1 address of the creator
    "config_signature": "0x123456...abcdef"     // EIP712 Signature of config_hash by ETH1 address. Proves that the creator created the config.
  },
  "operators": [                                // Operators of all Charon nodes in the cluster
    {
      "address": "0x123..abfc",                 // ETH1 address of the operator
      "enr": "enr://abcdef...12345",            // Charon node ENR
      "config_signature": "0x123456...abcdef",  // EIP712 Signature of config_hash by ETH1 address. Proves that the operator accepts the config.
      "enr_signature": "0x123654...abcedf"      // EIP712 Signature of ENR by ETH1 address. Allows this ENR to act on behalf of the operator.
    }
  ],
  "uuid": "1234-abcdef-1234-abcdef",            // Random unique identifier.
  "version": "v1.3.0",                          // Schema version
  "timestamp": "2022-01-01T12:00:00+00:00",     // Creation timestamp
  "num_validators": 100,                        // Number of distributed validators (n*32ETH staked) to be created in cluster.lock
  "threshold": 3,                               // Threshold required for signature reconstruction
  "fee_recipient_address":"0x123..abfc",        // ETH1 fee recipient address
  "withdrawal_address": "0x123..abfc",          // ETH1 withdrawal address
  "dkg_algorithm": "foo_dkg_v1" ,               // DKG algorithm for key generation
  "fork_version": "0x00112233",                 // Chain/network identifier
  "config_hash": "0xabcfde...acbfed",           // Hash of the initial configuration fields excluding operator ENRs and signatures
  "definition_hash": "0xabcdef...abcedef"       // Final hash of all fields (after all operators have added ENRs and signatures)
}
```

See the [cluster.Definition](../cluster/definition.go) and [cluster.Operator](../cluster/operator.go) Go structs for
details on how this `cluster-definition.json` object is (de)serialised and how the [SSZ](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/ssz/simple-serialize.md)
config hash and definition hash are calculated.

The creator `config_signature` and operator `config_signature` and `enr_signature` are [EIP712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signatures of **typed structured data** as opposed to just raw bytes. EIP712 enables users to see the object that they are signing in their wallet (ex: Metamask).
See [eip712sigs.go](../cluster/eip712sigs.go) for details on the EIP712 structure used to create these signatures.

The above `cluster-definition.json` is generated by the [dv-launchpad](https://launchpad.obol.dev/) provided as input to the `charon dkg` command which generates keys and the `cluster-lock.json` file.

The `cluster-lock.json` has the following schema:
```json
{
  "cluster_definition": {...},                              // Cluster definiition json, identical schema to above,
  "distributed_validators": [                               // Length equal to num_validators (n*32ETH staked).
    {
      "distributed_public_key":  "0x123..abfc",             // DV root pubkey
      "public_shares": [ "0x123..abfc", "0x123..abfc"],     // The public share of each operator (length of num_operators)
      "fee_recipient": "0x123..abfc"                        // Fee recipient address of this validator. Defaults to definition fee_recipient if empty.
    }
  ],
  "lock_hash": "0xabcdef...abcedef",                        // Hash of the cluster definition and distributed validators. Uniquely identifies a cluster lock.
  "signature_aggregate": "0xabcdef...abcedef"               // BLS aggregate signature of the lock hash signed by all the key shares of all the distributed validators. Proves that the key shares exist and attested to being part of this cluster.
}
```

`charon run` just requires a `cluster-lock.json` file to configure the cluster.

### Cluster Config Change Log

The following is the historical change log of the cluster config:
- `v1.4.0` **default**:
    - Added the `creator` nested structure to the cluster definition proving who created the cluster definition (including non-operators).
    - Refactored operator `config_signature` EIP712 structure to distinguish between operator and creator `config_signatures`.
- `v1.3.0`:
    - Refactored `config_hash`, `definition_hash` and `lock_hash` calculations by aligning with SSZ common types:
        - `ByteList[MaxN]`: Variable length with max limit for strings.
        - `BytesN`: Fixed length byte.
        - `Uint64`: numbers.
    - Refactored definition operator signatures: `config_signature` and `enr_signature` to use updated EIP712 structured types.
    - This version is compatible with [dv-launchpad](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/dv-launchpad) generated `cluster-definition.json`.
    - See example [definition.json](../cluster/testdata/cluster_definition_v1_3_0.json) and [lock.json](../cluster/testdata/cluster_lock_v1_3_0.json)
- `v1.2.0`:
    - Refactored all base64 fields to Ethereum's standard 0x prefixed hex.
        - Refactored definition operator signatures: `config_signature` and `enr_signature`.
        - Refactored definition fields: `config_hash` and `definition_hash`.
        - Refactored lock fields: `lock_hash`, `signature_aggregate` and `distributed_validators.public_shares`.
    - Remove definition operator `nonce` field since it isn't used for anything. Only support `nonce=0` for older versions.
    - See example [definition.json](../cluster/testdata/cluster_definition_v1_2_0.json) and [lock.json](../cluster/testdata/cluster_lock_v1_2_0.json)
- `v1.1.0`:
    - Added cosmetic `Timestamp` field to cluster definition to help identification by humans.
    - See example [definition.json](../cluster/testdata/cluster_definition_v1_1_0.json) and [lock.json](../cluster/testdata/cluster_lock_v1_1_0.json)
- `v1.0.0`:
    - Initial definition and lock versions.
    - See example [definition.json](../cluster/testdata/cluster_definition_v1_0_0.json) and [lock.json](../cluster/testdata/cluster_lock_v1_0_0.json)

This version of Charon (logic) supports the following cluster config versions (files): `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v1.2.0`.

## Flag Precedence

Charon uses [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration combined with [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
for cli commands.

In descending order, the Charon node checks the following places for configuration:
- From environment vars beginning with `CHARON_`, with hyphens substituted for underscores. e.g. `CHARON_BEACON_NODE=http://....`
- From the config file specified with the `-config-file` flag as YAML, e.g. `beacon-node: http://...`
- From CLI params, e.g. `--beacon-node http://...`

## Configuration Options
The following is the output of `charon run --help` and provides the available configuration options.
