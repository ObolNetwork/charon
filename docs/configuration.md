# Charon Configuration

This document describes the configuration options for running a charon node and cluster locally or in production.

## Cluster Config Files

> Note this is for Charon V1 and extends on [DKG](dkg.md) docs. Charon V0 still uses old manifest files.

A charon cluster is configured in two steps:
- `cluster-definition.json` which defines the intended cluster configuration without validator keys.
- `cluster-lock.json` which includes and extends `cluster-definition.json` with distributed validator bls public key shares.

The `charon create dkg` command is used to create `cluster-definition.json` file which is used as input to `charon dkg`.

The `charon create cluster` command combines both steps into one and just outputs the final `cluster-lock.json` without a DKG step.

The schema of the `cluster-definition.json` is defined as:
```json
{
  "version": "v1.0.0",                  // Schema version
  "num_validators": 100,                // Number of validators to create in cluster.lock
  "threshold": 3,                       // Optional threshold required for signature reconstruction
  "uuid": "1234-abcdef-1234-abcdef",    // Random unique identifier
  "name": "best cluster",               // Optional name field, cosmetic.
  "fee_recipient_address":"0x123..abfc",// ETH1 fee_recipient address
  "withdrawal_address": "0x123..abfc",  // ETH1 withdrawal address
  "algorithm": "foo_dkg_v1" ,           // Optional DKG algorithm
  "fork_version": "0x00112233",         // Fork version lock, enum of known values
  "operators": [
    {
      "address": "0x123..abfc",         // ETH1 operator identify address
      "enr": "enr://abcdef...12345",    // charon node ENR
      "signature": "123456...abcdef",   // Signature of enr by ETH1 address priv key
      "nonce": 1                        // Nonce of signature
    }
  ],
  "definition_hash": "abcdef...abcedef",// Hash of above field (except free text)
  "operator_signatures": [              // Operator signatures (seals) of definition hash
    "123456...abcdef",
    "123456...abcdef"
  ]
}
```

The above `cluster-definition.json` is provided as input to the DKG which generates keys and the `cluster-lock.json` file.

The `cluster-lock.json` has the following schema:
```json
{
  "cluster_definition": {...},                              // Cluster definiition json, identical schema to above,
  "distributed_validators": [                               // Length equal to num_validators.
    {
      "distributed_public_key":  "0x123..abfc",             // DV root pubkey
      "public_shares": [ "oA8Z...2XyT", "g1q...icu"],       // length of num_operators
      "fee_recipient": "0x123..abfc"                        // Defaults to withdrawal address if not set, can be edited manually
    }
  ],
  "lock_hash": "abcdef...abcedef",                          // Config_hash plus distributed_validators
  "signature_aggregate": "abcdef...abcedef"                 // BLS aggregate signature of the lock hash signed by each DV pubkey.
}
```

`charon run` just requires a `cluster-lock.json` file to configure the cluster.

Future work:
 - To add validators to an existing `cluster-lock.json`: look at adding migrations list to `cluster-lock.json`?
 - Unique operator identifiers: each cluster-lock has a path that derive ENRs from root `cluster-spec.json` ENRs.

## Flag Precedence

Charon uses [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration combined with [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
for cli commands.

In descending order, the Charon node checks the following places for configuration:
- From environment vars beginning with `CHARON_`, with hyphens substituted for underscores. e.g. `CHARON_BEACON_NODE=http://....`
- From the config file specified with the `-config-file` flag as YAML, e.g. `beacon-node: http://...`
- From CLI params, e.g. `--beacon-node http://...`

## Configuration Options
The following is the output of `charon run --help` and provides the available configuration options.

````
Starts the long-running Charon middleware process to perform distributed validator duties.

Usage:
  charon run [flags]
