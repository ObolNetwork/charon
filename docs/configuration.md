# Charon Configuration

This document describes the configuration options for running a charon node and cluster locally or in production.

## Flag Precedence

Charon uses [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration combined with [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
for cli commands.

In descending order, the Charon node checks the following places for configuration:
- From environment vars beginning with `CHARON_`, with hyphens substituted for underscores. e.g. `CHARON_BEACON_NODE=http://....`
- From the config file specified with the `-config-file` flag as YAML, e.g. `beacon-node: http://...`
- From CLI params, e.g. `--beacon-node http://...`

## Configuration Options
The following is the output of `charon run --help` and provides the available configuration options.

````
Starts the long-running Charon middleware process to perform distributed validator duties.

Usage:
  charon run [flags]

Flags:
      --beacon-node-endpoint string    Beacon node endpoint URL (default "http://localhost/")
      --data-dir string                The directory where charon will store all its internal data (default "./charon/data")
  -h, --help                           help for run
      --jaegar-address string          Listening address for Jaegar tracing
      --manifest-file string           The path to the manifest file defining distributed validator cluster (default "./charon/manifest.json")
      --monitoring-address string      Listening address (ip and port) for the monitoring API (prometheus, pprof) (default "127.0.0.1:8088")
      --p2p-allowlist string           Comma-separated list of CIDR subnets for allowing only certain peer connections. Example: 192.168.0.0/16 would permit connections to peers on your local network only. The default is to accept all connections.
      --p2p-denylist string            Comma-separated list of CIDR subnets for disallowing certain peer connections. Example: 192.168.0.0/16 would disallow connections to peers on your local network. The default is to accept all connections.
      --p2p-tcp-address strings        Comma-separated list of listening TCP addresses (ip and port) for LibP2P traffic (default [127.0.0.1:13900])
      --p2p-udp-address string         Listening UDP address (ip and port) for Discv5 discovery (default "127.0.0.1:30309")
      --p2p-udp-bootmanifest           Enables using manifest ENRs as discv5 boot nodes. Allows skipping external bootnode if key generation ceremony included correct IPs
      --p2p-udp-bootnodes strings      Comma-separated list of discv5 bootnode URLs or ENRs. Manifest ENRs are used if empty. Example URL: enode://<hex node id>@10.3.58.6:30303?discport=30301
      --p2p-udp-peerdb string          Path to store a discv5 peer database. Empty default results in in-memory database.
      --validator-api-address string   Listening address (ip and port) for validator-facing traffic proxying the beacon-node API (default "127.0.0.1:3500")
