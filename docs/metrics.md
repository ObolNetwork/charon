# Prometheus Metrics

This document contains all the prometheus metrics exposed by a charon node.

All metrics contain the following labels, so they are omitted from the table below:
- `cluster_hash`: The cluster lock hash uniquely identifying the cluster.
- `clustter_name`: The cluster lock name.
- `cluster_network`: The cluster network name; goerli, mainnet, etc.
- `cluster_peer`: The name of this node in the cluster. It is determined from the operator ENR.

The `cluster_*` labels uniquely identify a specific node`s metrics which is required
when storing metrics from multiple nodes or clusters in one Prometheus instance.
